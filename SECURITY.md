## Best Practices for Contributors

- **No PII:** Never commit Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or real-world credentials.
- **Sanitize Links:** Ensure all external links point to official, verified security resources.
- **Zero Trust:** Adhere to the "Assume Breach" mentality—don't trust inputs even if they originate from within the repo.
